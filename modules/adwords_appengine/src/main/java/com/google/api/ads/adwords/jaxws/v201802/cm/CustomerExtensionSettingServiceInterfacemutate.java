 *             treated like a set operation. Performing a set operation when there is no existing
 *             ExtensionSetting will cause the operation to be treated like an add operation.
 *             
 *             @param operations The operations to apply. The same {@link CustomerExtensionSetting} cannot be
 *             specified in more than one operation.
 *             @return The changed {@link CustomerExtensionSetting}s.
